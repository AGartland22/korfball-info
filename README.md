# Korfball - The Best Sport You've Never Heard Of

## Site Overview
Korfball is a Dutch sport with similarities to both Basketball and Netball. It is popular at university as a social and welcoming sport, and people who began playing at university often keep playing long after they graduate. The purpose of this website is to provide information to users about Korfball and to encourage them to sign up.

## Planning

Target Audience:

- Users who are interested in picking up a new sport.
- Users who have never heard of Korfball before.
- Users who have heard of Korfball but want further information, i.e rules clarifications and how to play.
- Users who want to find a Korfball club local to them.

## Color Scheme:

Initially, the colour scheme was to be based around dark blue and canary yellow to mimic the colours of a korfball ball. However, upon implementation this was found to be too bright and became unpleasant to look at. In order to improve User Experience (UX), a more muted colour scheme was chosen.
