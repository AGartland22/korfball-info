# Korfball - The Best Sport You've Never Heard Of

## Site Overview

Korfball is a Dutch sport with similarities to both Basketball and Netball. It is popular at university as a social and welcoming sport, and people who began playing at university often keep playing long after they graduate. The purpose of this website is to provide information to users about Korfball and to encourage them to sign up.

## Planning

Target Audience:

- Users who are interested in picking up a new sport.
- Users who have never heard of Korfball before.
- Users who have heard of Korfball but want further information, i.e rules clarifications and how to play.
- Users who want to find a Korfball club local to them.

## Color Scheme

Initially, a colour scheme of royal blue and canary yellow to simulate the colours of a korfball. However upon implementation, this was found to be too bright so I changed it to similar but more muted colours. The contrast grid above shows AAA values for all colours that were used on the site.

## Header

The header element is split stylistically to make a visual impact and more use of the negative space. I wanted a clean and easy to read website in order to allow users to get the information they came for more easily.

On the pages with the hero image, the split is directly underneath two players jumping for a korfball in the air. This creates visual interest in the hero image and header.

The contact form contains code from <https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com> which is credited here and also in the comments section of my CSS file.

## Footer

The footer is stylistically minimalist to avoid clutter. The standard links to social pages are included, although for the YouTube section I added a link to a korfball match on YouTube. This will allow users who are unfamiliar with the sport to see an example game.

## Fonts

The fonts used during this project were Montserrat for the title and nav bar, and Work Sans for the main text. These fonts are both clean and simple, which adds to the minimalist design philosophy of the page. These fonts were supplied by Google Fonts.

## Anchor tags on all pages

The anchor tags on all pages feature a highlight that displays which page the user is on currently. When on laptop or desktop, the links will highlight when hovered over with the cursor.

## Testing

I ran all code through the HTML and CSS code official code checkers. The only error with the HTML code was a stray </h1> closing tag in the main section. The CSS code contained no errors. I tested all the features I implemented on my deployed website: <https://agartland22.github.io/korfball-info/>

All internal links work correctly. All external links open in a new tab. I used Chrome DevTools to check the responsiveness of the website for different devices and used this as part of the design process. I used the mobile first principal of development when designing and building this website.

## Deployment

I delpoyed the page on GitHub as standard for Project Portfolio subsmissions.
